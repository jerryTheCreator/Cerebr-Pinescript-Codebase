These are the features he explained to me he wants in the indicator.

1. He wants to choose whether it should scan the whole chart or just a number of bars. He says he wants to know how the bot would work in a specific period of time. So there should be a parameter to choose the number of bars, or for "Whole chart".

2. The indicator should also show the exit points of every entry. This way, the user can know which entries ended in Profit or Loss. It should also calculate/display how many pips it went in profit or loss.

3. He wants something like a small dashboard at the top left corner, that will show some information about the indicator's performance. These are the information that will be displayed.
- Number of Trades: This one will count how many trades/entries the bot will enter.
- Wins/Losses: The indicator will show how many trades ended in profit or loss. This will help the user calculate the success rate.
- Wins/Losses in Pips: This will show the total pips in profits and the total pips in loss for all the entries it found


I hope you understand these features.

Questions:

1. Will the indicator still work, even though some parts of it will use Multi timeframe?
