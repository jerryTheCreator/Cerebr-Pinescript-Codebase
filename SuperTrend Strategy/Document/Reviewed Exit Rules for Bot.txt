This is a review of the exit rules for the SuperTrend xx Squeeze Momentum EA.

1. SuperTrend Exits: When the supertrend changes to an opposite direction. For example, when the Supertrend changes to 'Sell' during a long position.

2. MACD Exit: When the MACD has an opposite crossover. For example, when the MACD line crosses below the Signal line, during a long position.

3. Squeeze Momentum Exit: 
  ---- When the Light blue circles changes to dark blue circle.

  ---- The second exit signal is when histogram changes from a green histogram to a red histogram. This happens sometimes without the circles changing to dark blue. So that would be an exit signal.


For the breakeven rule, it should be reviewed as follows accordign to the client:

There should be a parameter that allows the user pick what happens when the dark histogram bar appears. There are two options:
- To Lock a percentage of profits, or
- To move the stop loss a certain percentage closer to the entry or to breakeven, just like I explained in the first document.


That's all the review on those rules.

Please focus on completing the indicator befoer continue the work on the bot. Thanks
